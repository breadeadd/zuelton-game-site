# Zuel.ton - Game Info & Ad Website üéÆüåê

**Zuel.ton** is a simple web-based project I created during Year 10 as an introduction to HTML and CSS. The website mimics a game information and advertising platform similar to those for popular games like **Valorant**, but for a fictional game I imagined.

This project served as a way to practice and develop skills in web design, user interface (UI) principles, and basic interactivity. It features simple, yet attractive designs using HTML and CSS to showcase an early understanding of responsive layouts and web development techniques.
